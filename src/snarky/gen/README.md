The files in here are autogenerated from the OCaml source, with full tracking of dependencies - that's what the dune file is for.

To regenerate them, check out the [mina repository](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina) and run `make snarkyjs` (heads up: there are a lot of things to install and set up if you build mina the first time).
